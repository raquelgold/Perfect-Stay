Unit was as described.\",\"Great stay, host left us be and was very attentive. Thanks\",\"Great accommodation and great location!\",\"Great location right in Yaletown which meant we were within walking distance to shops, restaurants, clubs, etc. Beautiful building with an amazing view. There were a few strands of hair in my bed and in the bathroom that didn't belong to my friend or I which wasn't the greatest site, but the space was clean overall. The host who came down to meet us didn't introduce himself and wasn't very polite. In their message they said they would help us with our bags but that wasn't offered upon arrival. We were given two keys to access the apartment, but because you have to use a key fob to get into the building and to use the elevator, having two separate keys was kind of pointless so my friend and I still had to meet at the apartment after going our separate ways for the day. Would stay there again but I would hope for a warmer welcome or some sort of contactless entry option, and two key fobs instead of one.\",\"We had a terrible stay.\",\"Visited Vancouver for our honeymoon, and this place was in a great location.

The communication was good and fast but unfortunately the place is not brand new as advertised but has sufficient issues that were communicated with the owner. They tried to be accommodating but it still is not what it was advertised for.\",\"Great location, great facilities, great view. Nice and clean.

The apartment met our needs perfectly, located within walking distance to the convention center and aquarium, and we loved the way the place is decorated. Overall it was a cozy stay, and Shasha made it an easy process!\",\"This place was super nice.\",\"Great location for the event at Mercedes-Benz Stadium! Just a short walk from the condo! Condo was Cozy and neat! Excellent host!\",\"Nice place\",\"Thankful for private garage and no public access into the building without code or keyfob\",\"I’ve stayed at many AirBnbs and I would say this was my favorite stay. The location is great for walking to the Dome, even at night. The place was very clean and represented the pictures well. Shoshanna was so helpful and available at any time. I can’t say enough about how easy this made our trip!\",\"Shoshanna is a very responsive and courteous host. She was extremely quick to respond to messages and immediately addressed any need that arose. We did not have enough towels for our group of 4 and Shoshanna immediately had her cleaning staff deliver. She lives an hour away and isn't at the unit frequently so I'm sure she has already addressed this with them to avoid this in the future. A hot water issue was also immediately rectified by a prompt visit by a plumber who was very friendly. Overall, these were not deal breakers as Shoshanna rectified as soon as I messaged her. The location is great if attending an event at Mercedez Benz stadium, definitely within walking distance to the stadium and other nearby top attractions. If you need quiet while you sleep, be aware that the property sits right next to a cargo train track that runs up to several times an hour. We heard them as late as 1 am and as early as 6 am. The only other minor issue we ran into was that uber and food delivery drivers had difficulty finding where to pick up or deliver. Uber called and then found us immediately. Unfortunately, the postmates driver was not as considerate and reported our food as \\\"deliverered\\\", which never occurred. He did pick the food up from the restaurant so we do not know if he actually just gave it to someone else outside or just chose not to deliver.\",\"I recommend this wonderful place to anyone staying in Atlanta.  Great host and great location.\",\"Great place, great host and great location.  Easy walk to Mercedes Benz stadium and cool local restaurants.  The Smoke Ring has great  BBQ and No Mas has great Mexican.  Will absolutely stay there again if in Atlanta.\",\"Shoshanna is an excellent host and a kind person.  Her communications are clear and accurate.\",\"Shoshanna was an excellent host available any time of day for any questions I may have had. The condo was very spacious, clean, offered all amenities and was within walking distance of the Mercedes Benz, State Farm, Aquarium and lots of restaurants. Shoshanna gave such great Southern Hospitality being my husband and I first time in Atlanta. I would definitely stay here again the next time we're in the Atl.\",\"Shoshanna is a phenomenal host. Her place is spotless and her hospitality is top notch. The condo is indeed in walking distance of the Mercedes-Benz stadium so that was very convenient for going to the game. Will definitely consider staying here again when I come back to Atlanta.\",\"Very clean,close to alot of shops in restaurants. The place was very clean\",\"You can walk to Mercedes-Benz Stadium and State Farm Arena. Shoshanna will help you with any questions about the place. Spacious, modern condo!\",\"Shoshanna is a fantastic hostess! Was very attentive to questions and helpful with checking in with building security codes, etc. Loved her 2 bedroom and 2 bath very spacious condo.  Kitchen was huge and had all appliances needed.

Tugba is a very responsive host. Kitchen is stocked and appliances work great. Services, like grocery stores/corner stores, etc are extremely limited in this area. Be aware that the lights from the stadiums can be on all night whether or not there is an event. Internet is strong. Workout area is nice. Overall, a good property in a transitioning area of downtown.\",\"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\",\"We had a wonderful stay. Simply the best experience we have had booking through Airbnb! The condo was spotless, the views were drop dead gorgeous, the beds comfy and the building was quiet, simply everything you want for an amazing stay.\",\"You cannot beat the view. My family and I watched multiple events at lumen field from the living room. Views of the mountains and the city. Spectacular stay. Didn’t want to leave.\",\"Best views in all of Seattle!!  Really just stunning, day or night, with water views, mountain views, city views, and of course, Lumen Field right out your window!  The introduction to motorized blinds made me wonder how I will ever learn to live without them again :)  But they are sheer, so if you are someone like me that prefers to sleep in a room with blackout shades, just remember to bring along a sleep mask.  Meanwhile my boyfriend slept just fine without one.  We had a fantastic four month stay here, and I would not hesitate to recommend Tugba's place to anyone looking for a great short term or long term stay in the city.\",\"Amazing place! The views are exactly as shown in the pics and the location is prime! Really enjoyed my stay and wouldn’t hesitate to stay there again.\",\"The host was great! Great communication the whole time and the apartment was amazing\",\"My boyfriend and I stayed at this apartment for 5 weeks and loved every second! We walked in to an immaculately clean unit with music playing and table settings out!<br/>The building is super secure which was important for me and is also a very dog friendly building - although as with most dog runs (2 in the building) they stiiiiink! Although, the amenities are great - we used the gym daily and even watched the Euro2020 Finals in one of the lounges. <br/>The neighborhood is a bit meh - it was still pretty quiet with short hours for most businesses. But.. THE VIEW!! I can’t say enough - the sunsets were amazing every night.<br/>We would definitely stay here again - especially once Seattle/Pioneer Square gets a bit more back to normal!<br/>We had a few issues with USPS, but nothing we couldn’t sort through and Tugba was always super responsive whenever we reached out.<br/>Also, Dylan at the front desk is my favorite and made our stay even more special. <br/>Highly recommend!\",\"Tugba was an amazing hostess. She met us at checkin and made sure we’re all set. The apartment view is breathtaking. The kitchen is well equipped. A very short walk to amazing restaurants in the international district. There was a soccer game and we literally watched the game from our bedrooms windows. the kitchen was well stocked with essentials such as oil, salt, coffee, sugar. they had drinks for us in fridge  which was a nice touch. Bed was comfy in master. A little soft mattress in guest bedroom. They had enough toiletries, soap, laundry detergent and cleaning supplies that lasted our entire stay. free parking was nice. The gym was great.\",\"Tugba’s place at the Wave is simply amazing. This is a new building overlooking the Puget Sound. The unit is on the 25th floor and has nothing that high anywhere near around it. On the south end, you can peer over and into Lumen field and on the west end you have the container shipping operation with its cranes on Puget Sound and to the northwest is the Ferris Wheel and Pike Place. On a clear day you can see the snow capped Olympics over the Puget Sound. It is lovely. <br/>The space has two desks to work in for a longer term rental. There is also a business center on the 2nd floor and a<br/>Gym/yoga area. Tugba can reserve gym use for you. Our host was very accommodating for our month long stay, and was always available for questions like when the internet went out that one time and for other issues. One of the things I liked the most was the garage for our rental car. Trash and recyclables was also easily disposed of in a room with chutes on the same floor as the condo. There is also rooftop access, but it’s shared with all residents. <br/>There is a wonderful convenience store within the building that doesn’t display its prices.  We should have noticed that before paying $21 for a carton of milk, pasta and tomato sauce. The building is also home to a trendy Japanese place called Matsu. <br/>One of the best things about the location is that you can walk 10 minutes up post alley to Pike Place and get fresh baked items at the many bakeries there.   <br/>I would love to return.\"]</td><td>{\"seller_id\":\"357567003\",\"url\":\"https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/357567003\"}</td><td>Seattle, Washington, United

Location is perfect for anyone looking to attend an event at Mercedes Benz Stadium (not even a 5 minute walk). Only was in the unit for a short amount of time as we just dropped off our bags and stayed the night after a concert then left early the next AM but was nice having somewhere within walking distance from the venue to just stay the night.\",\"Host was very communicative.\",\"Responsive and available to put the guest in the best conditions.\",\"Great place to stay near the GWCC!\",\"It was my first time in Atlanta, and I was terrified. Delvins was so relaxing and quiet, hardly a single sound all night\",\"Cons:<br/>- Some light switches didn’t work (like the bedroom light) had to use lamps instead. <br/>- Towel rack was broken, kept falling off. <br/>- Can easily head neighbors talking/footsteps<br/>- Bed cover is basically nonexistent/a thin sheet. Bring your own cover or blanket. <br/>- Unable to drive through entrance gate at night if you want to go out or have a late meeting (gate code needed owner to answer to get in)<br/>Pros:<br/>- Quiet neighborhood<br/>- Close to Stadium<br/>Overall, would be iffy about staying again.\",\"Thank you again\",\"Perfect stay!!  I had an event for the weekend at state farm and it was perfect walking distance.\",\"Delvin place was nice and clean and close to the Metro it was so easy to find.  Delvin even allowed us to check in early because of a cancelled flight. If we ever are down in Atlanta we would love to book again\",\"A nice place to stay\",\"Great\",\"Close to the stadium and conference enter, easy check-in.\",\"Everything was pretty clean and neat. Check in was easy and the stay was comfortable. I recommend bringing your own blankets if it is cold because there was only one blanket that wasn't thin. The stay overall was fine and there were a nice selection of apps to use on their Roku to watch media. It is also a quick walk to the Mercedes Benz and State Farm Arena if you are going to see a show.\",\"Good place, apartment was bit older but awesomely decorated. Location is great.\",\"Pretty good visit\",\"Delvin was great. Easy to work with and helpful. Clean and great location.\",\"Awesome place to stay! In walking distance to the Mercedes and State Farm arena\",\"A good spot !!\",\"great stay\",\"My stay at Delvin's - though very short - was absolutely perfect for my purposes. I was in town for an interview at the GWCC, and wanted to stay nearby, to avoid morning rush hour traffic in Atlanta. Delvin's apartment was comfortable, clean, and safe. It would be an amazing location for attending events at the Mercedes Benz stadium, the GWCC, or just exploring all of the fun things in that area of town. Check in and check out were an absolute breeze and communication with Delvin was very easy. He was proactive and provided great instructions regarding access to the apartment, WiFi, etc. If I return for fun, rather than work, I will certainly try to stay here again.\",\"Awesome stay. Great Location\",\"Very comfortable say, fantastic price, no hassles, great location\",\"Broken locks on the doors. Locks,  like somebody had force their way in and maybe broken into the place at some point. Big gashs in a black leather sofa. Baseboard molding that was not even attached to the wall. Mold at the base of every window in the place. smelled of mold they had scented air fresheners everywhere to hide the mold smell.<br/>White duct tape corners on each side of the dishwasher because it was cracked.<br/>Door knobs hanging instead of being attached to the door. Bedding and pillows were so lumpy and soft. Old. Neighborhood was not a place where I felt safe or comfortable renting an Airbnb. Very falsely advertised. Should not be allowed to be an Airbnb customer. I am starting to feel that I cannot trust Airbnb with the people that they were allowing to be part of this organization. We have had many good experiences, but more bad experiences. Airbnb needs to monitor their clientele a little more closely.\",\"Nothing wrong. Responsive.

         "[\"great location, the check in was easy, the place was clean, great experience \uD83D\uDE01\uD83D\uDCAF\",\"We stayed in Zodiac’s unit for a month and really enjoy it!\",\"Great location, and a helpful host. Unit was as described.\",\"Great stay, host left us be and was very attentive. Thanks\",\"Great accommodation and great location!\",\"Great location right in Yaletown which meant we were within walking distance to shops, restaurants, clubs, etc. Beautiful building with an amazing view. There were a few strands of hair in my bed and in the bathroom that didn't belong to my friend or I which wasn't the greatest site, but the space was clean overall. The host who came down to meet us didn't introduce himself and wasn't very polite. In their message they said they would help us with our bags but that wasn't offered upon arrival. We were given two keys to access the apartment, but because you have to use a key fob to get into the building and to use the elevator, having two separate keys was kind of pointless so my friend and I still had to meet at the apartment after going our separate ways for the day. Would stay there again but I would hope for a warmer welcome or some sort of contactless entry option, and two key fobs instead of one.\",\"We had a terrible stay.\",\"Visited Vancouver for our honeymoon, and this place was in a great location. We enjoyed out stay in the beautiful apartment! Also appreciated how responsive the host is!\",\"Place was clean, instructions on arrival clear, good location, fairly hassle free. \uD83D\uDC4D\uD83C\uDFFB\",\"It was a great experience really clean and beautiful view\",\"We really enjoyed our stay! The location was amazing. The views from our balcony were beautiful. The apartment was really clean when we arrived. All the amenities we needed were there. It was a fantasist stay and would definitely come back In the future!\",\"Really great location and view of the city. The communication was good and fast but unfortunately the place is not brand new as advertised but has sufficient issues that were communicated with the owner. They tried to be accommodating but it still is not what it was advertised for.\",\"Great location, great facilities, great view. Nice and clean. Absolutely amazing apartment, would highly recommend.\",\"Great location! Great views! Great amenities! Communication was efficient and prompt. Would definitely stay here again.\",\"Great location in downtown with a beautiful view and a great host! excellent support and responsiveness and hospitality. Will be back!\",\"Nice clean. Good location. This is a very beautiful apartment.\",\"If looking for a beautiful view in a clean pet friendly airbnb with an organized and communicative host, this is it.\",\"We had a good stay. We ran into a few problems with some things in the unit but Cong was quick to resolve them and communicated well with us.\",\"great, clean place, prompt service and communication\",\"21st floor, great view, very clean, and host is very active in helping guests check in\",\"Amazing location, very nice and clean place.\",\"Very easy to deal with!\",\"It was great\",\"Nice clean place!\"]",

         "[\"Shasha was very responsive and helpful with detailed communication. The apartment met our needs perfectly, located within walking distance to the convention center and aquarium, and we loved the way the place is decorated. Overall it was a cozy stay, and Shasha made it an easy process!\",\"This place was super nice.\",\"Great location for the event at Mercedes-Benz Stadium! Just a short walk from the condo! Condo was Cozy and neat! Excellent host!\",\"Nice place\",\"Thankful for private garage and no public access into the building without code or keyfob\",\"I’ve stayed at many AirBnbs and I would say this was my favorite stay. The location is great for walking to the Dome, even at night. The place was very clean and represented the pictures well. Shoshanna was so helpful and available at any time. I can’t say enough about how easy this made our trip!\",\"Shoshanna is a very responsive and courteous host. She was extremely quick to respond to messages and immediately addressed any need that arose. We did not have enough towels for our group of 4 and Shoshanna immediately had her cleaning staff deliver. She lives an hour away and isn't at the unit frequently so I'm sure she has already addressed this with them to avoid this in the future. A hot water issue was also immediately rectified by a prompt visit by a plumber who was very friendly. Overall, these were not deal breakers as Shoshanna rectified as soon as I messaged her. The location is great if attending an event at Mercedez Benz stadium, definitely within walking distance to the stadium and other nearby top attractions. If you need quiet while you sleep, be aware that the property sits right next to a cargo train track that runs up to several times an hour. We heard them as late as 1 am and as early as 6 am. The only other minor issue we ran into was that uber and food delivery drivers had difficulty finding where to pick up or deliver. Uber called and then found us immediately. Unfortunately, the postmates driver was not as considerate and reported our food as \\\"deliverered\\\", which never occurred. He did pick the food up from the restaurant so we do not know if he actually just gave it to someone else outside or just chose not to deliver.\",\"I recommend this wonderful place to anyone staying in Atlanta.  Great host and great location.\",\"Great place, great host and great location.  Easy walk to Mercedes Benz stadium and cool local restaurants.  The Smoke Ring has great  BBQ and No Mas has great Mexican.  Will absolutely stay there again if in Atlanta.\",\"Shoshanna is an excellent host and a kind person.  Her communications are clear and accurate.\",\"Shoshanna was an excellent host available any time of day for any questions I may have had. The condo was very spacious, clean, offered all amenities and was within walking distance of the Mercedes Benz, State Farm, Aquarium and lots of restaurants. Shoshanna gave such great Southern Hospitality being my husband and I first time in Atlanta. I would definitely stay here again the next time we're in the Atl.\",\"Shoshanna is a phenomenal host. Her place is spotless and her hospitality is top notch. The condo is indeed in walking distance of the Mercedes-Benz stadium so that was very convenient for going to the game. Will definitely consider staying here again when I come back to Atlanta.\",\"Very clean,close to alot of shops in restaurants. The place was very clean\",\"You can walk to Mercedes-Benz Stadium and State Farm Arena. Shoshanna will help you with any questions about the place. Spacious, modern condo!\",\"Shoshanna is a fantastic hostess! Was very attentive to questions and helpful with checking in with building security codes, etc. Loved her 2 bedroom and 2 bath very spacious condo.  Kitchen was huge and had all appliances needed. Security parking was a plus. And 3-4 blocks walking from Mercedes Benz Stadium.  That was great! Would definitely stay there again.\",\"Shoshanna was an excellent host! She was very responsive and friendly.  The apartment was very clean and within walking distance to the Mercedes Benz stadium! We had a fabulous time. The balcony was a wonderful extra!\"]",

         "[\"It’s a well furnished, clean apartment in a nice building. Tugba is a very responsive host. Kitchen is stocked and appliances work great. Services, like grocery stores/corner stores, etc are extremely limited in this area. Be aware that the lights from the stadiums can be on all night whether or not there is an event. Internet is strong. Workout area is nice. Overall, a good property in a transitioning area of downtown.\",\"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\",\"We had a wonderful stay. Simply the best experience we have had booking through Airbnb! The condo was spotless, the views were drop dead gorgeous, the beds comfy and the building was quiet, simply everything you want for an amazing stay.\",\"You cannot beat the view. My family and I watched multiple events at lumen field from the living room. Views of the mountains and the city. Spectacular stay. Didn’t want to leave.\",\"Best views in all of Seattle!!  Really just stunning, day or night, with water views, mountain views, city views, and of course, Lumen Field right out your window!  The introduction to motorized blinds made me wonder how I will ever learn to live without them again :)  But they are sheer, so if you are someone like me that prefers to sleep in a room with blackout shades, just remember to bring along a sleep mask.  Meanwhile my boyfriend slept just fine without one.  We had a fantastic four month stay here, and I would not hesitate to recommend Tugba's place to anyone looking for a great short term or long term stay in the city.\",\"Amazing place! The views are exactly as shown in the pics and the location is prime! Really enjoyed my stay and wouldn’t hesitate to stay there again.\",\"The host was great! Great communication the whole time and the apartment was amazing\",\"My boyfriend and I stayed at this apartment for 5 weeks and loved every second! We walked in to an immaculately clean unit with music playing and table settings out!<br/>The building is super secure which was important for me and is also a very dog friendly building - although as with most dog runs (2 in the building) they stiiiiink! Although, the amenities are great - we used the gym daily and even watched the Euro2020 Finals in one of the lounges. <br/>The neighborhood is a bit meh - it was still pretty quiet with short hours for most businesses. But.. THE VIEW!! I can’t say enough - the sunsets were amazing every night.<br/>We would definitely stay here again - especially once Seattle/Pioneer Square gets a bit more back to normal!<br/>We had a few issues with USPS, but nothing we couldn’t sort through and Tugba was always super responsive whenever we reached out.<br/>Also, Dylan at the front desk is my favorite and made our stay even more special. <br/>Highly recommend!\",\"Tugba was an amazing hostess. She met us at checkin and made sure we’re all set. The apartment view is breathtaking. The kitchen is well equipped. A very short walk to amazing restaurants in the international district. There was a soccer game and we literally watched the game from our bedrooms windows. the kitchen was well stocked with essentials such as oil, salt, coffee, sugar. they had drinks for us in fridge  which was a nice touch. Bed was comfy in master. A little soft mattress in guest bedroom. They had enough toiletries, soap, laundry detergent and cleaning supplies that lasted our entire stay. free parking was nice. The gym was great.\",\"Tugba’s place at the Wave is simply amazing. This is a new building overlooking the Puget Sound. The unit is on the 25th floor and has nothing that high anywhere near around it. On the south end, you can peer over and into Lumen field and on the west end you have the container shipping operation with its cranes on Puget Sound and to the northwest is the Ferris Wheel and Pike Place. On a clear day you can see the snow capped Olympics over the Puget Sound. It is lovely. <br/>The space has two desks to work in for a longer term rental. There is also a business center on the 2nd floor and a<br/>Gym/yoga area. Tugba can reserve gym use for you. Our host was very accommodating for our month long stay, and was always available for questions like when the internet went out that one time and for other issues. One of the things I liked the most was the garage for our rental car. Trash and recyclables was also easily disposed of in a room with chutes on the same floor as the condo. There is also rooftop access, but it’s shared with all residents. <br/>There is a wonderful convenience store within the building that doesn’t display its prices.  We should have noticed that before paying $21 for a carton of milk, pasta and tomato sauce. The building is also home to a trendy Japanese place called Matsu. <br/>One of the best things about the location is that you can walk 10 minutes up post alley to Pike Place and get fresh baked items at the many bakeries there.   <br/>I would love to return.\"]",

         "[\"Delvin was nice and accommodating by letting us have a flexible check in due to us attending a concert in the area. Location is perfect for anyone looking to attend an event at Mercedes Benz Stadium (not even a 5 minute walk). Only was in the unit for a short amount of time as we just dropped off our bags and stayed the night after a concert then left early the next AM but was nice having somewhere within walking distance from the venue to just stay the night.\",\"Host was very communicative.\",\"Responsive and available to put the guest in the best conditions.\",\"Great place to stay near the GWCC!\",\"It was my first time in Atlanta, and I was terrified. Delvins was so relaxing and quiet, hardly a single sound all night\",\"Cons:<br/>- Some light switches didn’t work (like the bedroom light) had to use lamps instead. <br/>- Towel rack was broken, kept falling off. <br/>- Can easily head neighbors talking/footsteps<br/>- Bed cover is basically nonexistent/a thin sheet. Bring your own cover or blanket. <br/>- Unable to drive through entrance gate at night if you want to go out or have a late meeting (gate code needed owner to answer to get in)<br/>Pros:<br/>- Quiet neighborhood<br/>- Close to Stadium<br/>Overall, would be iffy about staying again.\",\"Thank you again\",\"Perfect stay!!  I had an event for the weekend at state farm and it was perfect walking distance.\",\"Delvin place was nice and clean and close to the Metro it was so easy to find.  Delvin even allowed us to check in early because of a cancelled flight. If we ever are down in Atlanta we would love to book again\",\"A nice place to stay\",\"Great\",\"Close to the stadium and conference enter, easy check-in.\",\"Everything was pretty clean and neat. Check in was easy and the stay was comfortable. I recommend bringing your own blankets if it is cold because there was only one blanket that wasn't thin. The stay overall was fine and there were a nice selection of apps to use on their Roku to watch media. It is also a quick walk to the Mercedes Benz and State Farm Arena if you are going to see a show.\",\"Good place, apartment was bit older but awesomely decorated. Location is great.\",\"Pretty good visit\",\"Delvin was great. Easy to work with and helpful. Clean and great location.\",\"Awesome place to stay! In walking distance to the Mercedes and State Farm arena\",\"A good spot !!\",\"great stay\",\"My stay at Delvin's - though very short - was absolutely perfect for my purposes. I was in town for an interview at the GWCC, and wanted to stay nearby, to avoid morning rush hour traffic in Atlanta. Delvin's apartment was comfortable, clean, and safe. It would be an amazing location for attending events at the Mercedes Benz stadium, the GWCC, or just exploring all of the fun things in that area of town. Check in and check out were an absolute breeze and communication with Delvin was very easy. He was proactive and provided great instructions regarding access to the apartment, WiFi, etc. If I return for fun, rather than work, I will certainly try to stay here again.\",\"Awesome stay. Great Location\",\"Very comfortable say, fantastic price, no hassles, great location\",\"Broken locks on the doors. Locks,  like somebody had force their way in and maybe broken into the place at some point. Big gashs in a black leather sofa. Baseboard molding that was not even attached to the wall. Mold at the base of every window in the place. smelled of mold they had scented air fresheners everywhere to hide the mold smell.<br/>White duct tape corners on each side of the dishwasher because it was cracked.<br/>Door knobs hanging instead of being attached to the door. Bedding and pillows were so lumpy and soft. Old. Neighborhood was not a place where I felt safe or comfortable renting an Airbnb. Very falsely advertised. Should not be allowed to be an Airbnb customer. I am starting to feel that I cannot trust Airbnb with the people that they were allowing to be part of this organization.
